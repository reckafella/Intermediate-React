# Intro to React Project

Welcome to the React project! This repository contains the code for a React application.

I wrote this code as part of the [Intermediate React course]('https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react-v5/') taught by [Brian Holt]('https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/brian-holt/') on [Frontend Masters]('https://frontendmasters.com/').

Part of this code is a continuation to the Intro course covered in the [React]('https://github.com/reckafella/React') repository
